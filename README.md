# Crypto Compare
## Overview

A server that accepts a list of coins and a date in the past and returns the
difference in percentage between that time and now, sorted from best performing coin to worst.
E.g. the user sends this list: `BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE`
And the date `01/01/2020`
The system will return: `DOGE: 3010%, BTC: 200%, ETH: 50%, BNB: -10%`
